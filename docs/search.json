I am eager to learn as much as possible about these industries, understand the unique ways they tie together, and begin getting experience helping people!"

The course has helped establish my baseline skills in open-source technologies like R and Quarto.\n\nDuring our first project, we constructed this website!\nIn this first lab assignment, we practiced comprehensively using our skills in R and Quarto so far. It was really helpful to be able to put everything together.\nWe also connected our websites in RStudio to a repository in Github, which helped strengthen my abilities and confidence with Git.\nThere were a lot of elements of style as well, which added a new interesting dimension, and a really fun way to use code to achieve results.\nI’m realizing that a large part of these coding projects could be troubleshooting and looking for simple errors that are throwing off the entire line of code. It’s important to just stay patient and take your time going through the components of the website.\n\n\nSkills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research (SUPER)\nDuring the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters, I participated in the ESS program Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research (SUPER). My research, in collaboration with Dr. Greg Newman, focused on citizen science and exploring participation patterns among users of the CitSci.org platform. Below is a collection of links to my work, which will be updated as it is made available!\nAnalyzing Participation Patterns Across Citizen Science Projects on CitSci.org\n\nExplored various user participation patterns on the CitSci platform.\nConducted data analysis on project types, user engagement, and collaboration levels.\nGenerated hypotheses on how different factors like project tags, difficulty levels, and recommended age groups influence participation.\nCollaborated with Dr. Greg Newman, co-creator of CitSci.org, to classify data into meaningful groups, improving user self-categorization.\nContributed to the development of a more intuitive platform for future project submissions.\n\nLinks\n\nCitSci\nCSU SUPER Program"

    "section": "How I Got Here",
    "text": "How I Got Here\nI was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where I developed a deep love for the outdoors early on. My family took frequent trips to the Florida Keys, St. Augustine, and Orlando, and we spent lots of time fishing, boating, going to the beach, and just being outside. These experiences gave me an appreciation for nature long before I ever considered studying it.\nGrowing up near the Florida Everglades also played a big role in shaping my perspective. My elementary school was built on filled-in swamp land, and we took field trips to learn about the Everglades’ ecosystems and their significance to Florida. Even though I didn’t realize it at the time, these experiences helped me understand the importance of biodiversity and conservation – ideas that would later influence my academic and career path.\nI didn’t start out studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. Initially, I planned to major in Psychology, but I realized it just wasn’t the right fit. I decided to explore Environmental Science and Political Science, and everything seemed to click. By the time I transferred to Colorado State University, I knew I wanted to focus my studies on the intersection of environmental policy and sustainability.\nSince moving to Colorado in 2018, I’ve only become more passionate about environmental issues. My coursework at CSU has opened my eyes to the social and political aspects of sustainability, illustrating how environmental challenges are deeply intertwined with equity, policy, and community engagement. I’m particularly interested in bridging the gap between scientific research and real-world application, ensuring that sustainability efforts are accessible and inclusive. Whatever form my work takes – whether through policy, outreach, or hands-on conservation – I am excited to make a difference and contribute to the creation of a more sustainable and equitable future."

    "text": "My Interests & Passions\nOver the years, my interests have expanded beyond just environmental science – I’m particularly drawn to how sustainability intersects with equity, policy, and community engagement. Some key areas that drive my work include:\nBiodiversity and Conservation\nI’ve always been interested in ecosystems and the role that biodiversity plays in environmental health. Learning more about nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience at CSU has deepened my understanding of how interconnected the world is. I’m very interested in how we can balance conservation with human land use and the role of science in shaping environmental policy.\nEnvironmental Justice and Policy\nOne of the most critical aspects of sustainability is the idea that it isn’t just about science – it’s also about people. Global climate change and resource management are deeply political issues, and the communities most affected by environmental challenges are often those with the least power to influence solutions. I’m passionate about ensuring that sustainability efforts are equitable and that marginalized communities always have a voice in climate solutions.\nCommunity Engagement and Science Communication\nEcosystem Science isn’t just about research – it’s about making information accessible and involving people in creating tangible solutions. I love opportunities to bridge the gap between academic research and its real-world application, whether that’s through outreach, education, or policy work. I hope that my work in this field will help to create solutions that are practical, inclusive, and sustainability."

I’ve had the opportunity to interview so many esteemed scientists, as well as curating materials like newsletters, articles, and social media posts to inform the public of the work being done at NREL. This experience has reinforced my passion for bridging science and policy, ensuring that sustainability solutions can be implemented in meaningful ways.\nResearch & Coursework\nSome of my favorite, most formative academic experience have included:\n\nExploring ecosystem nutrient cycling and how small shifts in biodiversity can have large-scale ecological impacts.\nDiving into environmental justice and sustainability policy, learning about how systemic inequities shape climate impacts.\nStudying disturbance regimes, like wildfires and hurricanes, and their role in long-term ecosystem resilience.\n\nCommunity Engagement & Volunteering\nOutside of research, I’ve also looked for ways to get involved in environmental outreach and sustainability efforts. I’ve participated in local conservation projects, contributed to participatory science projects, and reached out to professionals in the sustainability field."
