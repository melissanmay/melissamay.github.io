Since I moved to Colorado in 2018, I have loved the ecosystem, whether it be the mountains or the local wildlife, and I knew that I would love to pursue a career in which I can help maintain that beauty.\nOutside of that, I have a strong passion and interest in political science and how policy implementation and public outreach can impact the environment and natural resource management. I am eager to learn as much as possible about these industries, understand the unique ways they tie together, and begin getting experience helping people!\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
