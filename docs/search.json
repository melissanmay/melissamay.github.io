    "text": "Hi! My name is Melissa May and I am an undergraduate student at Colorado State University. I am majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Political Science. Since I moved to Colorado in 2018, I have loved the ecosystem, whether it be the mountains or the local wildlife, and I knew that I would love to pursue a career in which I can help maintain that beauty.\nOutside of that, I have a strong passion and interest in political science and how policy implementation and public outreach can impact the environment and natural resource management. I am eager to learn as much as possible about these industries, understand the unique ways they tie together, and begin getting experience helping people!\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

Here is a collection of links! - In this assignment, we built a static users site with Github Pages - Includes a Github repo for access to all the code. Look at how high quality my work is!\nDuring the fall 2024 and spring 2025 semesters, I participated in the ESS program Skills for Undergraduate Participation in Ecological Research (SUPER). My research, in collaboration with Dr. Greg Newman, focused on citizen science and exploring participation patterns among users of the CitSci.org platform. Below is a collection of links to my work, which will be updated as it is made available! Analyzing Participation Patterns Across Citizen Science Projects on CitSci.org - Explored various user participation patterns on the CitSci platform. - Conducted data analysis on project types, user engagement, and collaboration levels. - Generated hypotheses on how different factors like project tags, difficulty levels, and recommended age groups influence participation. - Collaborated with Dr. Greg Newman, co-creator of CitSci.org, to classify data into meaningful groups, improving user self-categorization. - Contributed to the development of a more intuitive platform for future project submissions."
