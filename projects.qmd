In the spring of 2025, I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code and did some interesting data science. Here is a collection of links!

- In this assignment, we built a static users site with Github Pages
- Includes a Github repo for access to all the code.
Look at how high quality my work is!
